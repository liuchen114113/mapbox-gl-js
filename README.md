**Curvemap GL JS** is a JavaScript library for interactive, customizable vector maps on the web. It takes map styles that conform to the
[Curvemap Style Specification](https://www.curvemap.com/curvemap-gl-js/style-spec), applies them to vector tiles that
conform to the [Curvemap Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/hymap/vector-tile-spec), and renders them using
WebGL.

Curvemap GL JS is part of the [cross-platform Curvemap GL ecosystem](https://www.curvemap.com/maps/), which also includes
compatible native SDKs for applications on [Android](https://www.curvemap.com/android-sdk/),
[iOS](https://www.curvemap.com/ios-sdk/), [macOS](http://curvemap.github.io/curvemap-gl-native/macos),
[Qt](https://github.com/curvemap/curvemap-gl-native/tree/master/platform/qt), and [React Native](https://github.com/curvemap/react-native-curvemap-gl/). Curvemap provides building blocks to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you
create. To get started with GL JS or any of our other building blocks,
[sign up for a Curvemap account](https://www.curvemap.com/signup/).

In addition to GL JS, this repository contains code, issues, and test fixtures that are common to both GL JS and the
native SDKs. For code and issues specific to the native SDKs, see the
[curvemap/curvemap-gl-native](https://github.com/curvemap/curvemap-gl-native/) repository.
